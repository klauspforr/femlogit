# femlogit
This repository contains an implementation of a multinomial logistic regression with fixed effects as described by Chamberlain (1980, p. 231) for Stata. The implementation is described in Pforr (2014, 2017).

# FAQ / known bugs
* The factor variable notation is not implemented, i.e. indicator variables and interaction termns have to be constructed manually. 
* It is by design impossible to estimate effects on the outcome probabilities. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate ordinary marginal effects. You can only estimate odds ratio effects and elasticities. I recommend to use the <lincom> command.
* The ado throws an error if the robust option is specified and the model contains collinear variables which are omitted.
